Postmortem Report: Database Connectivity Outage on May 25, 2024



Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
May 25, 2024, 3:00 PM - 5:30 PM (PDT)
Impact:
The primary database became unresponsive, causing the web application to fail when performing data operations. Users experienced timeouts and errors when trying to access the application, affecting 60% of active users.
Root Cause:
A network partition in the data center led to database nodes being unable to communicate with each other, causing the primary database to become isolated.

Timeline
3:00 PM - Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating database connection timeouts.
3:05 PM - Engineers observed increased error rates and latency in database queries.
3:10 PM - Initial investigation focused on database performance metrics, suspecting high query load.
3:20 PM - Customer complaints confirmed widespread impact on the application.
3:30 PM - Incident escalated to the Network Operations team to investigate potential network issues.
3:45 PM - Misleading debugging paths included checking for database schema changes and recent deployment logs, which showed no anomalies.
4:15 PM - Network partition identified as the root cause affecting database node communication.
4:30 PM - Network team worked on restoring connectivity between database nodes.
5:00 PM - Network partition resolved, and database nodes resumed normal communication.
5:30 PM - All systems confirmed operational and stable, postmortem analysis initiated.



Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
A network partition occurred within the data center, causing a loss of connectivity between database nodes. This partition isolated the primary database, rendering it unable to handle queries or maintain consistency.
Resolution:
Once the network partition was identified, the Network Operations team reconfigured the network settings to restore connectivity between the database nodes. They monitored the database cluster to ensure that nodes were communicating correctly and that data integrity was maintained.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:
Enhance network monitoring to detect and alert on partition events more quickly.
Implement automatic failover mechanisms to switch to standby databases during connectivity issues.
TODO List:
Improve Network Monitoring:
Set up detailed network partition alerts.
Monitor inter-node communication metrics.
Automatic Failover Mechanisms:
Implement automated failover for database nodes to ensure high availability.
Test failover procedures regularly to ensure they work as expected.
Database Cluster Configuration:
Review and update database cluster configuration to improve resilience against network partitions.
Ensure database nodes are distributed across multiple network segments to reduce the impact of partitions.
Incident Response Training:
Conduct regular training for engineers on network partition detection and resolution.
Develop runbooks for common network and database issues.








Visual Aid

Conclusion
This outage highlighted the importance of robust network configurations and rapid detection mechanisms. By implementing the outlined corrective measures, we aim to enhance our system's resilience and ensure minimal disruption in the event of future network issues.
